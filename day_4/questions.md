## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

   The purpose of a **function** is to let you group statements together to perform a certain task in a series that can be repeated. It helps to keep your code organized and gives you the ability to reuse the function, so you don't have to keep repeating the same statement over and over again.

1. What is a parameter?

   A **parameter** is used when you need specific information to perform a certain function. Parameters provide the pieces of information that is passed to a function in order for the function to execute a return value.

1. What is a return value?

   A **return value** is the response to a function when the function is declared and called. If a return value isn't specified, the function returns `undefined`.

1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

  ```javascript
   function hello() {
   console.log("Sam I am");
 };
 hello();//Sam I am
  ```

1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

  ```javascript
  function hello_someone(parameter1) {
    var parameter1 = name
    console.log(parameter1 + " I am");
  }
  ```

1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?

   Use the function name followed by parentheses: `functionName();`

```javascript
  function hello_someone(parameter1) {
    var parameter1 = name
    console.log(parameter1 + " I am");
  };
  hello_someone();//name + "I am"
  ```

1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?

   I don't think I have questions right now-- it's just a lot of information to process.
